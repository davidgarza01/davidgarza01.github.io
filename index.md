# Fish 12/14/2018
This week I learned how to use the raspberry pi. Second, I learned how to display things into the raspberry pi, but it was upside down. Third, I learned how to  rotate the text. Fourth, I learned how to change the color (255, 0 ,0) using this 3 numbers you can switch them up to change the color. Fifth, I learned how to put a smiley face, using the pixel. Sixth, I did not understand why you couln not put only one pixel, then I found out that it is supposed to be 64, because there is 64 invdividual lights in the raspberyy pi. 

# Class 11/30/2018 
This week we learend a how to write classes more explicitly. First, I learend what is de "__init__" function. Second, I learned how to use the dot in a variable in a  parameter (i.e self.values, becasue I did not understood it theat well before. Third, we are doing a card game, we are splitting, shuffling, etc. Fourth, we are doing everything inside functions, and we have a differnet file for the suit, card or rank. Sixth, I finally understan how the returns work, in a function when you put return it means that that value is going outside of the function. 

# Functions 11/02/2018
This week i learned how to do functions. Second, I learned that functions only one whenever you tell them to work, they can be in the programm but they will not start working unless you tell it to. Third, I learned that you can but variables inside the function (def cars(red, blue). Fourth, I learned that those variables follow the chronological order. Fifth, so when you put a variable outside the function you can put (chevy = camaro, doedge = charger), then write ( cars(chevy, doedge) ) and it will use chevy as red and doedge as blue. Sixth, I learned how to to bubble sort and selection sort.

# While & Scopes 10/26/2018
This week I learned hoy wo to do while loops and scopes. Second, I learned that a while loop is like an if statement and it will keep running until it is false. Third, I lersned hot to add  or remove things in a dictionary a dictionary. Fourth, I also learned how to add several dictionaries into one list. Fifth, I learned how to loop each value of a dictionary by using dictionary.VALUES():. Sixth, I learned that in a scope you can define the variable and tat variable will be only be existing inside that scope.

# Dictionary 10/19/2018
This weekend I learned how to do dictionaries. Second, I learned that dictionaries are similar to list, but the difference is that in dictionares it does not matter the cronological order. Third, a dictionary works with pairs, is like having a variable  inside of a list (i.e "First Name" , "David). Fourth, to select something from a dictionary instead of selecting th numberl you select the key of what you eant to put. Fifth, I learned that to do a dictionary instead of using the brackets like the list, you use a curvy bracket {}. Sixth, in a dictionary you can put more information than in a list. 

# For Loops 10/12/2018
This weekend I learned how to do for loops. Second, I learned that in the for loops we have to put a variable inside that determines each letter or number of the list or input. Third, I learned that a strong number is defined as a number thas has the sum of the factorial of each digit is equal to its original number. Fourth, I was able to factor the number with a code and then check if it was a strong numbers. Fifth, i learned how to display how many strong numbers are in between 1 and any number. Sixth, in this week homework I learned how to factor a number in a code, and how to put if statements in the for loop to see if the input is true and if it is to display the phonetic alphabet, whith the word that is in the input. 

# Loops Pt 1 10/05/2018
This week I learned how to put an append on a list, that it adds a string to the list. Second, I also learned how to slice things in python, in a list. Third, I learned how to reverse things on a list, letter, numbers, etc. Fourth, I larned how to add things on the input to a list and then display them. Fifth, this week in the homewrok we incorporated variables, with if's and elif's and also list. Sixth, I also learned how to split a list, into words or paragraphs.

# Lists 09/27/2018
This week I learned how to do lists. Second, I learned that you can several strings, then you define the list in it puts all of the strings listed. Third, I learned how to do plots in python and then it automatically displays the graph. Fourth, when you write the append, it adds a string to the list as the last number. Fifth, I learned that in the lists you don have to put the commas inside of the quotes, they can be outside just separating them. Sixth, I learned how to sort or but a word backwards in python. 

# Conditionals 09/21/2018

This week I learnes how to write if or elif statements in python, where to put them, if we need to put them nested. Second, I also learned when and how to put colons, after what statemnets should I put it. Third, I also learned how to use the else statement, that the only thing you can put right next top it is a colon. Fourth, this week we used a lot the grater than, less than, equals, to use with the if and elif statements. Fifth, in the quiz I learned that in a variable you cannot start with a number, but you can put a number anywhere else but in the begining pf the variable. Sixth, in the begginign I had the mistake that in the if I used to put "=", but then I learned that it needed to be "==".

# Variables, Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned how to use python more extensively. Second, I learned the meaning of a floating point, boolean, integer and string. Third, I earned how to put comments, print strings, add variables and strings. Fourth, I also learned how to write square roots, add, divide multiply, write parenthesis. Fifth, i also learned how to concatenate strings, that a string cannot be added with an integer or floating point.

# Intro 09/07/2018

This week I learned, the 3 R's: Respect yourself, respect other, respect the learning environment.Second, that the computer operates the same regardless of the interface. Third, what a keyword is, and what text or text string is. Fourth, Mr. Gold introduced us a little bit into python, writing text by using "" and "print". Fifth, Mr Gold taught us how to use github, we created an account and did an exercise to try it. Sixth, we also learned some vocabulary words like, output, interface, console, etc.
